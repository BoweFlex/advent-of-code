# advent-of-code
Repository for tracking my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. 

My first "official" advent of code will be 2023. This is kind of my reintroduction to coding, most of my recent work has been in Ansible and bash scripts, so I expect to be pretty rusty.
I'll throw some work on 2022 puzzles in here as I have time before 2023 begins to warm myself up. I'll be starting out writing solutions in Python because that's what I'm most comfortable with,
but I will try to make it clear if that changes.
## Directory Structure
``` shell
<year>/                                # Year for advent of code challenges, i.e. 2023 
└── <language>/                        # Language solutions are written in, i.e Python. I may include multiple languages in one year as I attempt to learn different languages.
    └── <day>                          # Subfolders for specific days may be created if the solution makes more sense in multiple files.
```

## Dependencies/Usage
I'll be trying to keep these solutions as simple and homegrown as possible. If any major dependencies are required, or executing the script is more complicated than a standard execution 
(i.e. `python3 <script>` for a python script) I will try to place a README in that subfolder.
